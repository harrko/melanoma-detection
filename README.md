# Melanoma Detection

This approach precedes conventional melanoma classification with a semantic segmentation step. In the training set the skin lesion surrounding skin is masked to improve performance. Including a semantic segmentation step improves performance on average by 2% measured on 8 test sets. The code uses PyTorch and OpenCV.
